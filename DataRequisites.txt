There are certain prerequesites for data if it is to be trained using Deep Learning.
And for machine learning in general, there are methods for removing unreliability from data.

Need to separate images into training, testing and validation sets as a requirement to train the model properly.

Proper directory structure:
A data folder with 3 subfolders: train, validation and test
Each subfolder has two subfolders, dog and cat. These represent class names and there should be as many of these as there are distinct classes.
